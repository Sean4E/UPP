## Platform Expansion (Month 2+)

### Additional Sales Channels

**Gumroad**
- Lower fees (10% vs Blender Market's 25%)
- Good for direct traffic
- Set up after initial momentum

**itch.io**
- Indie-friendly audience
- Good for discoverability
- Consider for v1.5+

**Your Own Website**
- Maximum profit (just payment fees)
- Requires traffic generation
- Consider for established product

### Pricing Strategy

**Launch Price:** $24

**Future Considerations:**
- Holiday sales (20-30% off)
- Bundle with future products
- Increase price with major version updates

**Never:**
- Race to the bottom on price
- Devalue below $15 (signals low quality)
- Do permanent discounts (trains customers to wait)
