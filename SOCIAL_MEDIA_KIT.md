Launching Ultimate Palette Pro

Color palettes that sync between your browser and Blender. In real-time.

7 harmony modes, 24 presets, image extraction, and zero hex-code copying.

$24 addon + FREE web app

Thread on how I built it [thread emoji]
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The problem:

You find perfect colors online. Then spend 10 min copying hex codes between tabs.

I got tired of this. So I built something better.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
The solution: WebSocket sync.

Start the server in Blender. Connect from the web app.

Now any color change in either app updates the other. Instantly.

No external dependencies. Just Python + your browser.

Title: I built a color palette addon with real-time web sync - Ultimate Palette Pro

Hey r/blender!

After months of development, I'm launching Ultimate Palette Pro - a color palette tool that syncs between Blender and your browser in real-time.

**The Problem It Solves:**
I was tired of finding palettes online, then manually copying hex codes into Blender. Tab switching kills creativity.

**What It Does:**
- Generate palettes using 7 color theory harmony modes
- Extract colors from any image
- Real-time WebSocket sync between web and Blender
- One-click apply to materials
- Export to PNG, SVG, JSON, CSS, Tailwind

**Pricing:**
- Blender Addon: $24 (lifetime updates)
- Web App: FREE for everyone

**Links:**
- Blender Market: [link]
- Free Web App: https://sean4e.github.io/UPP/
- GitHub: https://github.com/sean4e/UPP

The sync feature is the game-changer IMO. Keep the web app on a second monitor, change colors there, Blender updates instantly.

Happy to answer any questions!
