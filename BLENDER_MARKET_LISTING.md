## Full Description

### Stop Tab-Switching. Start Creating.

**Ultimate Palette Pro** bridges the gap between inspiration and implementation. Generate stunning color palettes using proven color theory, extract colors from any image, and sync everything between your web browser and Blender in real-time.

---

### Why Ultimate Palette Pro?

**The Problem:** You find a beautiful color palette online, then spend 10 minutes copying hex codes back and forth between browser tabs and Blender. Inspiration fades. Workflow breaks.

**The Solution:** Generate palettes directly in Blender, or use our free web app on a second monitor. Every change syncs instantly via WebSocket. Zero copy-pasting. Pure creativity.

---

### Key Features

#### Color Harmony Engine
Choose from 7 scientifically-proven harmony modes:
- **Complementary** - High contrast, vibrant combinations
- **Triadic** - Balanced, colorful three-color schemes
- **Tetradic** - Rich four-color palettes
- **Analogous** - Smooth, harmonious gradients
- **Split-Complementary** - Vibrant but approachable
- **Square** - Four equally-spaced hues
- **Monochromatic** - Elegant single-hue variations

Each mode uses proper color theory mathematics to ensure your palettes always work together.
